### Tutorial (for windows)
---
In the LazyFiles folder open the file called main.py or run it in a terminal and just follow the instructions there.

After it runs you will have a different number of new excel files which you can just copy and paste into your worklog.

Disclaimer: If you re-run it multiple times you might hit the chatgpt limit so you need to give it a few minutes.
